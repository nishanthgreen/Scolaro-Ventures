The story revolves around a school boy, who gets transfered to an unkown world where he faces many dangers, overcoming
obstacles as well as trying to find a way to get back home.

It is an introductory level, to get you familiarize with the KEYS.

### Level 1
This is a basic level, where u can collect coins and kill enemies by jumping on them. You can get to level to by using 
a portal, which is available at the end of this level.

which has some unique function. Same as previous level you can get to next level using the portal.
