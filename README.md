## About the game
The story revolves around a school boy, who gets transfered to an unkown world where he faces many dangers, overcoming
obstacles as well as trying to find a way to get back home.

This game was conceived as a four level game where each level is difficult than the previous level only in terms of the game
development concepts inculcated. The objective was to develop a game thereby learning the game development cycle using Godot. Users
who wish to learn Godot can use our project either as a template or a reference to build their own 2D platformer.
